# Configuration

All configuration is done through environment variables. Every variable has a sensible default, so SnapOtter works out of the box without setting any of them.

| `PGID` | `999` | Run the container process as this GID. Set to match your host group for bind mounts (`id -g`). |

## Docker example

```yaml
services:
  SnapOtter:
    image: snapotter/snapotter:latest
    ports:
      - "1349:1349"
    volumes:
      - SnapOtter-data:/data
      - SnapOtter-workspace:/tmp/workspace
    environment:
      - AUTH_ENABLED=true
      - DEFAULT_USERNAME=admin
      - DEFAULT_PASSWORD=changeme
      - MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB=200
      - CONCURRENT_JOBS=4
      - FILE_MAX_AGE_HOURS=12
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## Volumes

The Docker container uses two volumes:

- `/data` -- Persistent storage for the SQLite database and user files. Mount this to keep users, API keys, saved pipelines, and uploaded images across container restarts.
- `/tmp/workspace` -- Temporary storage for images being processed. This can be ephemeral, but mounting it avoids filling up the container's writable layer.
